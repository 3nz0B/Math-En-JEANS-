This problem is from the 2024 Math en JEANS conference "Epreuve de sagesse"
The problem consists of starting with the number 3 and putting it to the power of 3, which gives x.
You then take 3Ë†x wich gives you y. You would then take 3^y etc ... 
You repeat this process 1111 times, and the objective is to find as many digits as possible from that number.
